    I often build my projects as I get new ideas. Some ideas of mine have been 
        on my mind <br> for a long time, some come only recently. Either way, I set goals for myself and my main<br> goal is to build some kind of story around which all my websites would be built in.  <br><br> 
        One example is "ScrollingBar", for which I got an idea a long time ago. But ingredients <br> for its implementation were born only a short time ago.
